									Armenians, in their country, have a number of historical traditions relating to the rise of Christianity.
									<br>
									Firstly, take for instance passage 12.20-23 from the gospel of John. According to Armenian tradition, these heathens, who, through apostle Phillip’s mediation, wanted to meet Jesus, were Armenians (or, at the very least, a part of them were).
									<br>
									The legend of King Abgar is also connected to these passages from the gospel of John. And because the Abgars, kings of Osroene, were also considered kings of southern Armenia, it is therefore entirely possible that Armenians had met with Jesus Christ quite early on, even before the apostles’ dissemination.
									[...]
									<!-- <br>
									Secondly, according to Tertullian of the Latin church, in “The Acts of the Apostles”, passages 2.8-11, “inhabitants of Judea” should instead be “Armenians”. And this becomes even more likely when we realize that Armenia, like all countries of the Middle East, contained Jewish communities, that with time, were assimilated into that of the inhabitants.
									<br>
									Within Armenian history, and according to Moses of Khoren, the Bagradit House’s jewish origins were already quite notable (the Bagradits ruled over Armenia from the end of the 9th century to the mid 11th century). [...] -->

									The Armenians call it also ; ‘Zatik’. Hratchia Adjarian in his Etymological Dictionary  explains the meaning of the name as ‘immolation’, and ‘sacrifice’.
									<br>
									The resurrection of Christ is the essence of the Christian faith. St. Paul says : If Christ has not been raised, your faith is empty; you are still in your sins (1 Corinthians 15:17).

									The Armenian genocide was the systematic ethnic cleansing of more than 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Turkey during World War I. It is the first genocide of the 20th century which will always be remembered as the century of genocides. The divine word proclaims: God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work, Ecclesiastes 3:17.

								<h3>Pentecost/Hokekaloust <br> (Sunday, 23rd of May, 2021)</h3>
								<p align="justify">
									Pentecost means ‘the 50th day’. The feast is celebrated after 50 days from Easter. The Armenian Apostolic Church prefers to call it ‘Hokekaloust’ which means ‘the coming of the Holy Spirit’. The event has been told by St. Luke in the second chapter of The Acts of the Apostles. Jesus promised saying : I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high, Lk 24:49.

								<h3>Can you talk about the importance of religious education?</h3>

In order to develop it, we first need to accept it, just as we develop our body through physical exercise and our minds through schooling. The growth of the spirit is tied to religious education; in our case, Christian education. [...]</p>

								<h3>What would you like to tell the new generation of parents?</h3>
								<p align="justify">As parents, we need to consider spiritual education as similarly important as physical and mental education. When our children are baptized, the godfather asks thrice that the child wants “Faith, hope, love, and baptism.” To fulfill this, the parent should bring their child to Church every Sunday, and enroll them in Sunday school, so that they can learn and begin to understand the Bible.։ [...]</p>

								The Dove, the Holy Spirit sent by God the Father, descending from heaven like a bellow of a gale
								and like a lightning, empowered the disciples, who were sitting at the holy Upper room, 
								with the divine fire which did not burn up them.
								<br>
								The Dove is immaterial and inscrutable. He knows all the mysteries of God,
								and receiving from the Father the mystery of the majestic Second Coming of Christ
								tells us about it.
								(The apostles preached the consubstantiality of the Holy Trinity).
								<br>
								Blessing to the highest Heaven, to the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father.
								The apostles experienced the ecstasy by drinking from the life-giving Cup,
								and invited the earth to heaven.
